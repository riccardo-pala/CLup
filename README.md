## Scope
**CLup** is a booking service for grocery shopping. This software is focused on easing the access to the supermarkets during coronavirus emergency which imposed strict rules that must be observed by society. Deployment and usage of this application allow store managers to monitor entries and prevent people forming crowds outside the supermarkets. The service wants to ensure that distances between people are maintained and restrictions about the limited number of accesses in a building are respected.

CLup offers its users two types of reservation:
- **Real-Time Reservation** is the basic function of the software. The customer can search for his favourite supermarket and then he can retrieve a ticket to virtually line up from his smartphone. The system provides the expected time of entrance to access the supermarket and notifies users when their turn is coming. People who do not have access to the technology are not left out: fallback options to get a ticket avoiding the use of the application are provided. Indeed, one can obtain physical tickets from designated devices placed outside the stores.
- **Planned Reservation** is an advanced service which allows users to book a visit for doing grocery shopping at a later time. They can choose store, arrival time and duration of the visit from those available. This type of reservation gives the client a big advantage: the priority over those who made a real-time reservation. Indeed, users who plan a visit can jump the queue without waiting and can enter the store at the time fixed by the reservation. It could happen that customer request is not satisfied. For instance, a supermarket could be full at the selected time. In this case, the system provides him with suitable alternatives. CLup takes care of proposing the user another schedule for a visit in the same store; otherwise, it suggests some supermarkets, close to the selected one, available at the required time.
